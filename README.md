# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The model is trained on a dataset containing information such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI (Body Mass Index), diabetes pedigree function, and age.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving quality of life. Machine learning models can help healthcare professionals predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on their health parameters.

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assist in diabetes diagnosis. The model is trained on a dataset of clinical data collected from individuals, including demographic information and medical test results. By analyzing this data, the model can provide insights into an individual's risk of developing diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration in a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age in years

The target variable is a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
